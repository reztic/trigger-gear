powerups:
Make it spawn in the enemyOnscreen
when enemy dies, call addProjectile
make it go straight, if time permits make it go diagonally and bounce off walls
0 damage 1 hp
no power up: single shot, alternating double shot, 4 way shot
in collision detection, use instanceof and apply the right logic accordingly

Popcorn:
add powerup parameter: assign int to determine what type
add one more enemy, recolor for level 2

Add UI layer:
keeps track of lives
make it fade to back and fade in when switching level

Event:
add parameter to determine which enemy has powerup

add another layer for planets and debris: on top of both background layers

Bullets:
1 hp 1 damage

Player: --- DONE
delay per shot: quarter of a second


Boss:
When terminated, draw multiple explosion then (optional)big explosion fade to white then black
Boss should implement Enemy abstract class: if it doesnt then we should just get rid of Enemy.

Static Path:  ---- DONE just need to implement more path types
This will contain multiple paths and contain 2 methods:
getNextY(int currentX, int currentY, int pathType, int xOffset, int yOffset, int spawnTime);
getNextX(int currentX, int currentY, int pathType, int xOffset, int yOffset, int spawnTime);
 
MusicPlayer:
Try to make this always running in the background.
Implement fade in and fade out.
Should hold 2 files (2 filenames) so it can transition from one track to the next and 2 AudioInputStream
Consider using other formats: AudioSystem supports AU AIFF AIFF-C and SND.
Have repeat option and transition
Lower buffer size from 512k to 256k to compensate for 2 streams? may not be needed unless we want to overlap

Some changes:
Moved isTerminated to Entity

Resize  all entities
